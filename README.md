# noise_level_protocol
Raspberry Pi/Python project for noise level detection, recording and plot a noise level protocol (e.g. for loud neighbour)

Introduction:
There are many scripts for noise detectors, noise level meters and baby monitors out there. But nothing for my requirements. My neighbour had very noisy parties every day and night. So a noise level protocol was required for further steps. In my local jurisdiction the exact value is not the essential criteria; duration, frequency, kind and personal perception are also important.

Requirements:
-noise detection and save to csv
-record noise for later analysis as mp3
-create a noise level plot every day
-send me an email with the plot

Hardware:
Because I need onyl an approximate value of the noise (+-5 dB) and additionally make recordings I decided not to use a decibel meter but a usb microphone from Seacue for 12â‚¬.
The other component is a Raspberry Pi 3 running with Raspbian.

Installation:
Frist, notice that I'm not a programmer and never wrote a program before. So my scripts can be cumbersome. But it works and is easy to understand. I used absolute paths because the terminal, thonny and crontab have different home directories, not always "pi". Your microphone has to be set up and accessible as plughw:1,0.
Packages needed:
-plotly
-lame

1. Create a directory with the current date in the mp3 folder for the recordings. The make_dirs.py script will make this.

2. Calibrate your microphone: 
  Open detect.py and change -d 120 to -d 10 in line 28, this will shorten the recording time.
  Run detect.py at a quiet location, note down the first two numbers from  the measured values output (maximum amplitude and rms)         starting at 30 dB, then increase the volume of your speakers and up in intervals of five to.
  Simultaneous measure the noise level with your Smartphone e.g. with "Decibel X". I had the best results while playing "brown noise"     not only the sinewave.
  
3. Create a function with the values on https://mycurvefit.com/ one for maximum amplitude, one for rms.

4. Open detect.py, set the offset you want and replace the functions with yours on lines 39 and 41. The recording time is 120 seconds     and can be changed in line 28

5. If you wish an E-Mail with the plot, you can modify the gmail.py. Important is, that third party applications can access the mail        account.
  
6. Set up crontab to run your scripts periodically: type crontab -e in terminal and enter e.g.
    55 23 * * *  python /home/pi/Skripte/Neu03/make_dirs.py > /home/pi/Desktop/clog.log 2>&1 -q -f
    05 0 * * *  python3 /home/pi/noise/py_plot.py > /home/pi/Desktop/clog.log 2>&1 -q -f
    10 0 * * *  python3 /home/pi/noise/gmail.py > /home/pi/Desktop/clog.log 2>&1 -q -f


For mp3 analysis I recommend an application with waveform like mp3directcut.
At the end I want to thank all programmers who provide their scripts with open access. Maybe now someone can benefit from this.
